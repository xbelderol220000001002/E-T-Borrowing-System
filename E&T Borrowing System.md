# E&T Borrowing System:  A web-based borrowing system for equipment and tools in an open lab at the University of Immaculate Conception.

We have modeled our system after the University of the Immaculate Conception's borrowing system frequently utilized in the Open Lab. Our goal is to develop a seamless experience for students and teachers who wish to borrow computer-based systems in the open lab, ensuring a convenient process for all users.
